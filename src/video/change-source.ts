    // On some mobile browsers you cannot play a video until the user has explicitly touched the video to allow it.
    // Phaser handles this via the setTouchLock method. However if you have 3 different videos, maybe an "Intro", "Start" and "Game Over"
    // split into three different Video objects, then you will need the user to touch-unlock every single one of them.

    // You can avoid this by using just one Video object and simply changing the video source. Once a Video element is unlocked it remains
    // unlocked, even if the source changes. So you can use this to your benefit to avoid forcing the user to 'touch' the video yet again.

    // As you'd expect there are limitations. So far we've found that the videos need to be in the same encoding format and bitrate.
    // This method will automatically handle a change in video dimensions, but if you try swapping to a different bitrate we've found it
    // cannot render the new video on iOS (desktop browsers cope better).

    // When the video source is changed the video file is requested over the network. Listen for the onChangeSource signal to know
    // when the new video has downloaded enough content to be able to be played. Previous settings such as the volume and loop state
    // are adopted automatically by the new video.

    // Note: So far we've found that the videos need to be in the same encoding format and bitrate.
